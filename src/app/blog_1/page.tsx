          <h1 className="title">Tips for Balancing Work, Life, and Learning</h1>
          <p className="description">
            Balancing work, personal life, and ongoing education can be
            challenging but achievable with the right approach. Here are some
            tips:
            <span className="green">Prioritize tasks:</span> Identify what's
            urgent or most important in each area of your life and allocate time
            accordingly.
            <span className="green">Create a realistic schedule:</span> Use
            time-blocking methods to balance work, personal time, and learning.
            Build buffer times to prevent burnout. Communicate with employers or
            family: If you're working while studying, communicate your goals
            with those around you, whether it's your boss, co-workers, or
            family. They may offer support or flexibility.
            <span className="green">Take breaks:</span> Avoid overloading your
            schedule by including time for rest and self-care. Breaks help to
            refresh and improve concentration.
            <span className="green">Use time efficiently:</span> Leverage small
            pockets of time throughout the day—like during commutes or breaks—to
            study or review course materials.
